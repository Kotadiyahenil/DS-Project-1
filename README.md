🚀 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction 📊

🔍 Project Overview :

In the highly competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is crucial. This project leverages machine learning to predict customer churn, helping businesses take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

🎯 Goals:

✅ Identify key factors that contribute to customer churn
✅ Build predictive models to detect at-risk customers
✅ Deploy a machine learning model for real-time predictions

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various customer attributes, including:
📌 Demographics – Gender, Senior Citizen, etc.
📌 Account Details – Tenure, Payment Method, Contract Type
📌 Service Subscriptions – Internet, Phone, Streaming Services
📌 Billing Information – Monthly Charges, Total Charges

🛠️ Tech Stack

🚀 Python – Data analysis & machine learning
📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data preprocessing & visualization
🧠 Scikit-Learn – Model training & evaluation
🌐 Flask – Web application deployment
🔧 Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔️ Data Cleaning & Missing Value Treatment
✔️ Feature Engineering & Transformation
✔️ Data Visualization to uncover trends

📊 Sample Insights:

🔹 Customers with month-to-month contracts churn the most
🔹 Higher monthly charges correlate with a higher churn rate
🔹 Customers without tech support are more likely to leave

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Several models were tested to achieve the best performance:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	✅ 0.80 
Random Forest	✅ 0.80	
Support Vecor Machine ✅ 0.82
ADA Boost ✅ 0.81
XG Boost ✅ 0.80

🚀 Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Flask, making it accessible for real-time predictions.
